# Multi-Application Transaction Processing Suite

This project is a Python-based suite of applications designed to process and analyze transaction data from multiple platforms. It provides flexible and customizable solutions for handling various data sources, generating consolidated output files, and performing additional analysis.

## Applications

### 1. Dynamic Transaction Compiler

The Dynamic Transaction Compiler is designed to process and combine transaction data from multiple platforms.

Features:
- Dynamic platform configuration
- Customizable column mapping
- Supports multiple input files
- Generates a consolidated output file

### 2. Giving Dashboard

The Giving Dashboard is a powerful tool for analyzing and enriching consolidated transaction data.

Features:
- Import and process the final file from Dynamic Transaction Compiler
- Dynamic configuration of multiple lookup dictionaries for data enrichment
  - User-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting lookup dictionaries
  - Flexible output column naming for each dictionary
- Generate a wide range of analytical values:
  - Gift Range Chart
  - Gift Number Segment
  - Income Segment
  - Custom lookup values (e.g., Split, Designation, Member Status, MSA, etc.)
  - Month and Year
- Calculate Last Gift values for various fields
- Generate Date Segments for both current and last gifts
- Progress tracking and logging of operations

### 3. RFM Analyzer Helper

The RFM Analyzer Helper is a tool designed to process and analyze transaction data, focusing on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.

Features:
- Import and process the final file from Dynamic Transaction Compiler
- Generate multiple export types:
  - Export B: Detailed transaction data
  - Export F: Aggregated recurring donation data
  - Output 1: Constituent data with lookup values
- Configurable lookup dictionaries for data enrichment
- User-friendly GUI for easy operation and progress tracking

Logic for Export F:
- Group transactions by Recurring ID (Parent Donation ID)
- Calculate for each group:
  - Constituent Number (first Relationship ID)
  - Date Created (first Initial Recurring Contribution Date)
  - Sum of Donation Amounts
  - First Gift Date (earliest Date Clean)
  - Last Gift Date (latest Date Clean)
  - First Recurring Amount (Amount of the earliest transaction)

Logic for Output 1:
- Create a unique list of Constituent IDs
- Apply lookup dictionaries to enrich the data
- Organize columns in a specific order:
  1. Constituent ID
  2. Contact Channel Status
  3. Current Employer Name
  4. Most Recent DS Score in Database
  5. Most Recent DS Wealth Based Capacity in Database
  6. Current Portfolio Assignment in Database
  7. Age
  8. Age Range
  9. Race
  10. Gender
  11. [Dictionary lookup values]
  12. MSA
  13. Longitude
  14. Latitude

## Application Launcher

The suite includes an Application Launcher that allows users to choose which application to run:

- Easy switching between Dynamic Transaction Compiler, Giving Dashboard, and RFM Analyzer Helper
- Centralized access to all tools in the suite

## Key Advantages

1. **Flexibility:** All applications offer dynamic configuration options, allowing users to adapt the tools to various data structures and analysis needs.

2. **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, overcoming limitations often found in spreadsheet-based solutions.

3. **Customization:** Users can configure multiple lookup dictionaries in the Giving Dashboard and RFM Analyzer Helper, enabling tailored data enrichment with custom output column names.

4. **Automation:** Reduces manual data processing steps, increasing efficiency and reducing the potential for human error.

5. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The suite provides a wide range of analytical tools, offering insights into donor behavior, giving patterns, and RFM metrics.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`
4. Use the Application Launcher to choose between Dynamic Transaction Compiler, Giving Dashboard, and RFM Analyzer Helper
5. For the RFM Analyzer Helper:
   - Select the final file generated by the Dynamic Transaction Compiler
   - Configure lookup dictionaries as needed
   - Choose the desired export type(s)
   - Process the data to generate the selected outputs
